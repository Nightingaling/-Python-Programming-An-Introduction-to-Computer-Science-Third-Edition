</br>

## Review Questions
True/False

    1. Object-oriented design is the process of finding and defining a useful set of functions for solving a problem.
    2. Candidate objects can be found by looking at the verbs in a problem description.
    3. Typically, the design process involves considerable trial and error.
    4. GUIs are often built with a model-view architecture.
    5. Hiding the details of an object in a class definition is called instantiation.
    6. Polymorphism literally means "many changes".
    7. A superclass inherits behaviors from its subclasses.
    8. GUIs are generally easier to write than text-based interfaces.
