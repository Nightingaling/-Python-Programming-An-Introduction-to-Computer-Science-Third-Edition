Discussion (Answers)
  1a) Hardware vs Software
    Hardware: 
      - Refers to the physical components of a computer system (e.g., CPU, RAM, hard drives, keyboard, mouse).
      - Tangible and can be physically touched and seen.
      - Performs the actual tasks and operations according to the instructions provided by the software.

    Software:
      - Refers to the programs and operating systems that run on hardware and instruct it on what to do (e.g., operating systems, applications, drivers).
      - Intangible and consists of code written by programmers.
      - Provides instructions for the hardware to perform specific tasks.


  1b) Algorithm vs Program
    Algorithm: 
      - A step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a specific problem or accomplish a specific task.
      - Abstract concept and can be written in plain language or pseudocode.
      - Focuses on the logic and steps needed to solve a problem without considering implementation details.

    Program: 
      - A concrete implementation of an algorithm written in a specific programming language.
      - Executable and can be run on a computer.
      - Focuses on the specific syntax and commands required by a programming language to achieve the algorithm's steps


  1c) Programming Language vs Natural Language
    Programming Language:
      - Artificial language designed to communicate instructions to a computer.
      - Structured and follows strict syntax and semantics rules (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
      - Used to create software programs and cannot convey ambiguous or imprecise meaning.

    Natural Language:
      - Language used for everyday communication by humans (e.g., English, Spanish, Mandarin).
      - Flexible and often ambiguous, with complex grammar and syntax.
      - Used for general communication and can express a wide range of concepts, emotions, and ideas.


  1d) High-Level Language vs Machine Language
    High-Level Language:
      - Easier for humans to read, write, and understand (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
      - Abstracts away hardware details and allows programmers to focus on problem-solving.
      - Needs to be translated into machine language via a compiler or interpreter.

    Machine Language:
      - The lowest-level programming language, consisting of binary code (0s and 1s).
      - Directly executed by the computer's CPU without any translation.
      - Specific to the architecture of the computer's processor and difficult for humans to read and write.


  1e) Interpreter vs Compiler
    Interpreter:
      - Translates high-level language code into machine code line-by-line, executing each line immediately.
      - Does not produce an intermediate machine code file; instead, it executes directly.
      - Useful for scripting and debugging, but generally slower execution compared to compiled code (e.g., Python interpreter).

    Compiler:
      - Translates high-level language code into machine code all at once, producing an intermediate machine code file (e.g., an executable).
      - Requires the entire program to be compiled before execution.
      - Produces faster-executing programs but requires more time upfront for compilation (e.g., C++ compiler).


  1f) Syntax vs Semantics
    Syntax:
      - Refers to the rules and structure of how statements and expressions must be written in a programming language.
      - Focuses on the form and arrangement of symbols, keywords, and operators.
      - Syntax errors occur when these rules are violated (e.g., missing semicolon in C++).

    Semantics:
      - Refers to the meaning and behavior of the statements and expressions in a programming language.
      - Focuses on what the statements do and how they affect the program's execution.
      - Semantic errors occur when statements are syntactically correct but result in incorrect or unintended behavior (e.g., using a variable before it is initialized).

- It includes devices such as keyboards, mice, scanners, and microphones.
- This unit captures data and instructions from the user or other sources and sends them to the computer system for processing.


Output Unit:
- The output unit takes processed data from the computer and converts it into a form that can be understood by humans or used in the external environment.
- It includes devices such as monitors, printers, speakers, and projectors.
- This unit displays results, produces hard copies, or generates audio, providing the means for the computer to communicate with the user or other systems.


Central Processing Unit(CPU):
- The CPU, often called the "brain" of the computer, performs all the processing tasks.
- The CPU processes data, executes instructions, and controls the other components of the computer.


Main Memory:
- The memory unit stores data and instructions that are currently being used or processed by the CPU.
- It includes Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read-Only Memory (ROM).
    - RAM: Temporary storage that holds data and instructions while they are being used or processed; contents are lost when power is turned off.
    - ROM: Permanent storage that holds essential system instructions; contents are retained even when power is turned off.
- This unit provides the necessary working space for the CPU to perform tasks efficiently.


Secondary Memory:
- The storage unit is responsible for storing data and programs permanently.
- It includes devices such as hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), CDs, DVDs, and USB flash drives.
- This unit retains data even when the computer is powered off, ensuring that information can be retrieved and used at a later time.
- It provides large-capacity storage for operating systems, applications, and user data.

1. Weather Forecasting
Problem: Weather models rely on complex simulations of atmospheric conditions. Small errors in initial measurements, such as temperature or pressure, can lead to significant deviations over time.

Explanation: Due to the chaotic nature of weather systems, minor inaccuracies in numerical representation (like 0.1 being stored as 0.10000000000000000555) can amplify, leading to vastly different predictions. This phenomenon is often referred to as the "butterfly effect."


2. Financial Modeling
Problem: In financial markets, algorithms are used for trading and risk assessment. Small numerical errors can lead to incorrect predictions or trading decisions.

Explanation: Financial models often involve iterative calculations where small errors can compound. Over time, these compounded errors can lead to significant financial losses or incorrect risk assessments.


3. Chaos Theory Simulations
Problem: Simulations of chaotic systems, such as population dynamics, chemical reactions, or fluid dynamics, can be highly sensitive to initial conditions and numerical precision.

Explanation: In chaotic systems, slight variations in initial values can lead to drastically different outcomes. Numerical approximations can introduce errors that grow exponentially, making long-term predictions unreliable.


4. Engineering and Structural Analysis
Problem: Structural simulations in engineering, such as stress analysis of bridges or buildings, require high precision to ensure safety and reliability.

Explanation: Small numerical inaccuracies can lead to incorrect stress and strain calculations, potentially compromising the integrity of structures. In critical engineering applications, even tiny errors can have catastrophic consequences.
