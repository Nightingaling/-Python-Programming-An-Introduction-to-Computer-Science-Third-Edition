</br>

## Review Questions
True/False

    1. A Python while implements a definite loop.
    2. The counted loop pattern uses a definite loop.
    3. A sentinel loop asks the user whether to continue on each iteration.
    4. A sentinel loop should not actually process the sentinel value.
    5. The easiest way to iterate through the lines of a file in Python is to use a while loop.
    6. A while is a post-test loop.
    7. The Boolean operator or returns True when both of its operands are true.
    8. a and (b or c) == (a and b) or (a and c)
    9. not(a or b) == (not a) or not(b)
    10. True or False

## Multiple Choice
### 1. A loop pattern that asks the user whether to continue on each iteration is called a(n)
    a) interactive loop b) end-of-file loop
    c) sentinel loop d) infinite loop
    
### 2. A loop pattern that continues until a special value is input is called a(n)
    a) interactive loop b) end-of-file loop
    c) sentinel loop d) infinite loop
    
### 3. A loop structure that tests the loop condition after executing the loop body is called a
    a) pre-test loop b) loop and a half
    c) sentinel loop d) post-test loop

### 4. A priming read is part of the pattern for a(n)
    a) interactive loop b) end-of-file loop
    c) sentinel loop d) infinite loop
    
### 5. What statement can be executed in the body of a loop to cause it to terminate?
    a) if b) input c) break d) exit
    
### 6. Which of the following is not a valid rule of Boolean algebra?
    a) (True or x) == True
    b) (False and x) == False
    c) not(a and b) == not(a) and not(b)
    d) (True or False) == True
    
### 7. A loop that never terminates is called
    a) busy b) indefinite c) tight d) infinite
    
### 8. Which line would not be found in a truth table for and?
    a) TTT b) TFT c) FTF d) FFF
    
### 9. Which line would not be found in a truth table for or?
    a) TTT b) TFT c) FTF d) FFF
    
### 10. The term for an operator that may not evaluate one of its subexpressions is
    a) short -circuit b) faulty c) exclusive d) indefinite

</br>

## Discussion
### 1. Compare and contrast the following pairs of terms:
    a) definite loop vs. indefinite loop
    b) for loop vs. while loop
    c) interactive loop vs. sentinel loop
    d) sentinel loop vs. end-of-file loop

</br>

### 2. Give a truth table that shows the Boolean value of each of the following Boolean expressions, for every possible combination of "input" values. 
> Hint: Including columns for intermediate expressions is helpful.

    a) not (P and Q)
    b) (not P) and Q
    c) (not P) or (not Q)
    d) (P and Q) or R
    e) (P or R) and (Q or R)

</br>

### 3. Write a while loop fragment that calculates the following values:
    a) Sum of the first n counting numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n
    b) Sum of the first n odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 2n - 1
    c) Sum of a series of numbers entered by the user until the value 999 is entered. Note: 999 should not be part of the sum.
    d) The number of times a whole number n can be divided by 2 (using integer division) before reaching 1 (i.e., log2n)
