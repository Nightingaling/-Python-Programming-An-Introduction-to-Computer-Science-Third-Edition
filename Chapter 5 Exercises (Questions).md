## Programming Exercises
### 1. As discussed in the chapter, string formatting could be used to simplify the dateconvert.py program. Go back and redo this program making use of the string-formatting method.
    # dateconvert.py
    # Converts a date in form "mm/dd/yyyy" to "month day, year"

    def main():
        # get the date
        dateStr = input("Enter a date (mm/dd/yyyy): ")
    
        # split into components
        monthStr, dayStr, yearStr = dateStr.split("/")
    
        # convert monthStr to the month name
        months = ["January", "February", "March", "April",
                  "May", "June", "July", "August",
                  "September", "October", "November", "December"]
        monthStr = months[int(monthStr) - 1]
    
        # output result in month day, year format
        print("The converted date is:", monthStr, dayStr + ",", yearStr)

    main()

### 2. A certain CS professor gives 5-point quizzes that are graded on the scale 5-A, 4-B, 3-C, 2-D, 1-F, 0-F. Write a program that accepts a quiz score as an input and prints out the corresponding grade.

</br>

### 3. A certain CS professor gives 100-point exams that are graded on the scale 90-100:A, 80-89:B, 70-79:C, 60-69:D, <60:F. Write a program that accepts an exam score as input and prints out the corresponding grade.

</br>

### 4. An acronym is a word formed by taking the first letters of the words in a phrase and making a word from them. For example, RAM is an acronym for "random access memory." Write a program that allows the user to type in a phrase and then outputs the acronym for that phrase. Note: The acronym should be all uppercase, even if the words in the phrase are not capitalized.

</br>

### 5. Numerologists claim to be able to determine a person's character traits based on the "numeric value" of a name. The value of a name is determined by summing up the values of the letters of the name where "a" is 1, "b" is 2, "c" is 3, up to "z" being 26 For example the name "Zelle" would have the value 26 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 5 = 60 (which happens to be a very auspicious number, by the way). Write a program that calculates the numeric value of a single name provided as input.

</br>

### 6.Expand your solution to the previous problem to allow the calculation of a complete name such as "John Marvin Zelle" or "John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith." The total value is just the sum of the numeric values of all the names.

</br>

### 7. A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher based on the idea of shifting each letter of the plaintext message a fixed number (called the key) of positions in the alphabet. For example, if the key value is 2, the word "Sourpuss" would be encoded as "Uqwtrwuu." The original message can be recovered by "reencoding" it using the negative of the key. 
### Write a program that can encode and decode Caesar ciphers. The input to the program will be a string of plaintext and the value of the key. The output will be an encoded message where each character in the original message is replaced by shifting it key characters in the Unicode character set. For example, if ch is a character in the string and key is the amount to shift, then the character that replaces ch can be calculated as: chr(ord(ch) + key) .

</br>

### 8. One problem with the previous exercise is that it does not deal with the case when we "drop off the end" of the alphabet. A true Caesar cipher does the shifting in a circular fashion where the next character after "z" is "a". Modify your solution to the previous problem to make it circular. You may assume that the input consists only of letters and spaces. Hint: Make a string containing all the characters of your alphabet and use positions in this string as your code. You do not have to shift "z" into "a"; just make sure that you use a circular shift over the entire sequence of characters in your alphabet string.

### 9. Write a program that counts the number of words in a sentence entered by the user.

</br>

### 10. Write a program that calculates the average word length in a sentence entered by the user. 

</br>

### 11. Write an improved version of the chaos.py program from Chapter 1 that allows a user to input two initial values and the number of iterations, and then prints a nicely formatted table showing how the values change over time. For example, if the starting values were .25 and .26 with 10 iterations, the table might look like this:

</br>

### 12. Write an improved version of the futval.py program from Chapter 2. Your program will prompt the user for the amount of the investment, the annualized interest rate, and the number of years of the investment. The program will then output a nicely formatted table that tracks the value of the investment year by year. Your output might look something like this:

</br>

### 13. Redo any of the previous programming problems to make them batch-oriented (using text files for input and output).

</br>

### 14. Word Count. A common utility on UniX/Linux systems is a small program called "wc". This program analyzes a file to determine the number of lines, words, and characters contained therein. Write your own version of wc. The program should accept a file name as input and then print three numbers showing the count of lines, words, and characters in the file. 

</br>

### 15. Write a program to plot a horizontal bar chart of student exam scores. Your program should get input from a file. The first line of the file contains the count of the number of students in the file, and each subsequent line contains a student's last name followed by a score in the range 0-100. Your program should draw a horizontal rectangle for each student where the length of the bar represents the student's score. The bars should all line up on their left-hand edges. Hint: Use the number of students to determine the size of the window and its coordinates. Bonus: label the bars at the left end with the students' names.

</br>

### 16. Write a program to draw a quiz score histogram. Your program should read data from a file. Each line of the file contains a number in the range 0-10. Your program must count the number of occurrences of each score and then draw a vertical bar chart with a bar for each possible score (0-10) with a height corresponding to the count of that score. For example, if 15 students got an 8, then the height of the bar for 8 should be 15. Hint: Use a list that stores the count for each possible score. An example histogram is shown below:
